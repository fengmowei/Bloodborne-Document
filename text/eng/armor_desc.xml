Helm of one of sixteen ancient knights who served 
Godfrey, the first Elden Lord.
The axe ornamentation is the knight Ordovis' mark, 
displayed also by his men.
The conduits that cover this armor seethe with the 
power of life's crucible; that which coursed through 
the Erdtree in its primordial form.</text>

<text>
Armor of one of sixteen ancient knights who

Crucible and his men.

The conduits that cover this armor seethe with
the power of life's crucible; that which coursed

In time, the strength shown by these knights,
and even their appearance, came to be looked upon
with scorn, for having such close resemblance to chaos.</text>

Blindfold of exiled prophets who foresaw that their 
faith would end in flames — and were persecuted and 
driven from their homes as a result.
After all, what use is eyesight to those who claim 
to know the true path?</text>

<text>
Robe of exiled prophets who foresaw that their
faith would end in flames — and were persecuted
and driven from their homes as a result.
Its fabric scrapes against their skin like a file,
and the rickety cart wheel around the neck warns
passers-by not to lend an ear to their
meandering sermons.</text>

A mask of heavy stone resembling the wise Karolos, 
a forefather of the Raya Lucarian resurgence.
Magic scholars wear this mask to show the lineage of 
their glintstone study, as well as their vows of 
virtue and austerity.
An eye for the world and a keen mind — first and 
foremost, a sorcerer must surrender both to their craft.</text>

<text>
Robe worn by Raya Lucaria's magic scholars.
Those who dedicate themselves to the study of glintstones
formed from starry amber receive this modest
yet elegant deep blue garb along with their
vows of virtue and austerity.
But with extended life, one is apt to forget old vows.</text>

Cowl of a nomadic warrior.
The blue color of its fabric symbolizes brisk 
waters, as fluid and flowing as the sword in the 
hand of its wearer.
Just as still waters turn foul, stagnation leads to decay.
The warriors who wear this cowl must remain ever-drifting.</text>

An oval helmet large enough to cover any head. 
Very heavy and very hard. 
The inside of the helm is pitch black, keeping the 
crazed warrior within from panicking.
Perhaps its rather roomy interior also helps alleviate 
feelings of pressure and claustrophobia.</text>
